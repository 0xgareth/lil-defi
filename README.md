# lil-defi

lil-defi is a repro that deconstructs popular defi protocols and dapps to their core, inspired by [lib-web3](https://github.com/m1guelpf/lil-web3) from [m1guel](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf). Developed and tested with DappTools as an exploration into this library as an alternative to hardhat.
